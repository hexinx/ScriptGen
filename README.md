# ScriptGen
Automated SQL statement generation coded for quick data processing/integration from numerous SQL table sources.
This was developed as part of my DBMS project Database Management Systems (COP 5725) at UF. We had numerous data sources (tables converted from Microsoft Excel files, in the order of around 20 or 30). We realized that manually composing SQL statements for each source-destination table combination would prove to be too error-prone, I wrote this simple program to get it done.
